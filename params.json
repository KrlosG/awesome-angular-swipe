  "body": "# awesome-angular-swipe\r\n\r\nThis library uses $swipe and exposes a directive which allows mobile swipe feature on everything in the DOM.\r\n\r\nIt works only for mobile device. It will do nothing on desktop (except using the dev tool to mock a mobile behavior).\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\nYou might want to take a look at the index.html file inside the *example* folder.\r\nThe directive *swipe* can be used as a class or as an attribute. Then inject callbacks on right and left swipe, and template customization like so:\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"swipe\" swipe-left=\"doSomething\" swipe-right=\"doAnotherSomething\" left-template=\"leftTemplate.html\" right-template=\"rightTemplate.html\">\r\n      Swipe me!\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\nNote that *swipe-left* and *swipe-right* are functions, *left-template* and *right-template* are whatever templates you want.\r\nNote that the color of the swipeable block can be modified by overriding the following CSS property: *swipeable-color* (default value = '#fff'; the white color from the material design base colors).\r\n\r\n# Licence\r\n\r\nMIT\r\n\r\nCoded with love by Linagora folks (www.linagora.com, @AwesomePaaS)\r\n",
